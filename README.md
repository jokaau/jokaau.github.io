        The test shows that customers here can use good payment methods. For example, two of the most popular credit cards in the industry, Visa and Mastercard, are available as payment methods. Credit cards are by far the most popular way to pay online, but JokaRoom Casino has even more to offer. These include, for example, digital wallets, aka e-wallets. Skrill and Neteller are among those digital wallets that a customer can use. The advantage is that the customer can access the deposited credit immediately. However, to be able to use one of these providers, the provider must have a valid account. 

On the other hand, he needs a valid current account with online access if he wants to use instant banking. For that, the customer needs online banking access data and a valid TAN number. If these details are not available, the transaction cannot be executed. In addition, there must be sufficient funds in the bank account, otherwise the transfer will not be approved. Last but not least, the customer can also pay with the Paysafecard. This is a prepaid credit that the customer can purchase in advance and then transfer to his account by entering a code. It is up to him whether he transfers the whole amount or only a small part of it to his JokaRoom Casino gaming account, otherwise the transfer will not be approved.

        Bonus services have always been a tried and tested means for vendors to thank the customer for opening an account and taking care of them a little bit. Bonuses can have different faces. A bonus for new customers can be extra money to play, free spins for slots, or a combination of both.

The customer will find a modified form of the mixed option at JokaRoom Casino. First, it's bonus money for the customer. The very first deposit is sweetened by 300 percent. The maximum bonus amount is 150 euros. In addition, the customer gets 50 free spins, which can be used in all online slots provider.

In most online casinos, bonuses are tied to certain turnover conditions. Thus, the customer cannot claim the bonus and pay it out right away. Unfortunately, this does not work. As for the initial deposit, the player must wager the bonus amount 35 times before the money can be considered a real balance. The player has 30 days to meet these conditions. If he fails to meet the conditions of the bonus within that time, the bonus is cancelled. To meet the wagering requirements, the customer can, in principle, use all the games, but they are not counted equally. While most slots are paid at full wager, customers who may be fans of table games must settle for just ten percent.
